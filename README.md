# Frequentist-Inference

## Part A

## 1. Learning objectives

- the z-statistic
- the t-statistic
- the difference and relationship between the two
- the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences
- how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample
- the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
- how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval

## 2. An introduction to sampling from the normal distribution

In this section, you've been introduced to the scipy.stats package and used it to draw a small sample from the standard normal distribution. You've calculated the average (the mean) of this sample and seen that this is not exactly equal to the expected population parameter (which we know because we're generating the random variates from a specific, known distribution). You've been introduced to two ways of calculating the standard deviation; one uses n in the denominator and the other uses n-1 (Bessel's correction).
